# PriceScraper
"It pulls the first 10 prices of any product you want from the Trendyol website and shows them to you on the page."

# Note
If you are using this on a Turkish website, the program will work. However, if you are in a different country, you may need to adjust the "TL" in the if statement on line 29 according to the language of the page. For example, you can replace "TL" with "EURO" or it could be "$" symbol.
